        Ronya baby there is many many things that you do to me intentionally and unintentionally without even realizing and it is really hard to express all of it in words i would rather have all of them showing to you through actions instead and show you just what you do to me, lets start this with that Ronya you are the best thing to have ever happened to me and that your existence in my life brings me happiness warmth and excitement that i love and my life has been so so so much better with you in it and just by you existing and being with me to this day i am so happy i get to talk to you daily and see you almost daily and occasionally hangout with you and the time i have with you is the highlight of that day week and month and i truly enjoy every single second of what we have together and i love every part about it no matter what we are doing and what is happening, whenever you have to leave or our time is up the hardest thing about meeting you and spending time with you is always the goodbye at the end and i will never get over it i hate that specific goodbye and always wish we had a little bit more time together, which brings me to say this baby i will marry you and i want to always and always be by your side and be with you, and in order to do that ill get engaged to you marry you and move you into my house so we could live together, There is an infinite number of things i love about you and that i cherish about you please understand that i only placed 30 because i didn't want it to be too much and too overwhelming and i promise there is way and way more coming to this list in my heart and if you want ill tell you all about it face to face, and for the amount of things that i want to do with you ill list SOME of them down for you to read and i promise that is also a very long list, You need to know how irreplaceable you are to me and that in my life and heart there will never be another one like you and you are my first and last love Baby, what you have given me and what you made me feel goes deeper than any word could explain and deeper than any drawing could portray, You are special everything about you is so wonderful and beautiful, you are straight out from a fairytale and your value to me is immeasurable and nothing will ever match you, the luckiest encounter of my life and the luckiest ill ever be, ill always be grateful to the fact i was fortunate to be born in the same time as you and be blessed with meeting you getting to know you and loving you deeper than words could explain.
