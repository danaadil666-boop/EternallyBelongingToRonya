        Its honestly not that amazing of a story or anything like that it was all just a big series of chances and coincidences happening one after the other and each one weirder than the other, but ill never and ever forget how i saw you and how amazing you looked and how beautiful you just were and how shocked i was that it was possible for a human to ever look this wonderful and jaw dropping this is how i legit was

        I was so desperate and i was so shocked at the time i had no idea what to do i was so hopeless and lost because ive never had a crush and i legit didnt know what to do i never felt anything like that before it started with simple curiosity then it further developed to an interest and it kept developing further and further till you had a stable place in my mind and i would really often think about you and wonder what is it like to get to know such a person and know the person beneath that pretty face and just who she is genuinely this is how you would find me every night complaining to tigo about not knowing what to do and how to approach you

        i kept praying and praying that i would be able to talk to you someway or another and well you know it my prayers were answered and we somehow someway ended up at the right place at the right time all thanks to table tennis ill forever be grateful to that game, the first time we played i was so excited and happy i have no idea how i was able to hide my shock my shaking body from playing with you and how excited i was to just be able to play with you, that day itself was like a miracle to me you made me look forward to another day in university another day to get a chance to play with you and the second time we played that was it i couldn't stop myself any longer and after getting out of there i mustered up all the courage in my body and texted you and i was shaking i had no idea what you will do make fun of me for texting you, will you block me, will you just see the message and not reply, will you just ignore it, and what do i know you actually replied and somehow some way we kept talking and talking and i was so happy, the more i got to know you, the more i realized the inside of you mirrors the outside of you, you were so pure and beautiful it was such a bless getting to know you and talk to you more and more it was so amazing and i am so so happy i got the chance to because every moment spent knowing a little bit about you was so fun and so enjoyable you were such an amazing person to know more of and you still are, the more i found out about you the more i knew the more i realized i genuinely wanted you it was slowly turning from an interest to a crush and from a crush to love a really deep one for you at that, at the course of 3 months it was always on my tongue to tell you that i love you i want you i need you and i want to marry you and i could not bring myself to say it i wanted to delay it as much as i could , but i did everything i could to make it as obvious as possible that i love you that i need you i would jump at every chance i could get to scream to you with my actions that i love you i wanted my actions to tell you before my words ever did that i want you and that i love you and that i am desperate for you and that i will do every single thing possible to have you and be on your good side, then on a random night you told me what my intentions were with you and well i couldn't stop it anymore i had to tell you that i love you and i need you and i want to marry you Ronya you are that important to me you are someone i wanted to spend a full lifetime with on the first day of knowing you that's how strong of a hold you had on me and i was so happy i confessed but i was so anxious because i had no idea what your reaction will be and what you think of me and if you like me or not, then i spent 2 months in anxiety waiting on a random day at the gym you tell me that you had something to tell me when i am back i rushed as fast as i could and finished then you told me that you don't feel the same and that your answer is so no it has to be the most devastated i have ever felt in a minute then a few minutes later you told me 'My answer is yes, you idiot' and all of that negativity in me was gone and i felt a surge of happiness that i still cant describe and that i still can't believe and i am so so happy that you decided to give me a chance and agree to marrying me because i will make you the happiest i possibly can and try to be the best possibly i possibly could for you to this day this is still my reaction to you saying yes to me and ill never ever get over it because the prettiest most beautiful this gorgeous funny amazing wonderful and sweet girl decided to be with me and give me a lifetime full of her and i am so happy for that the happiest and the luckiest because the most perfect woman in this world picked me and it will forever be my greatest source of pride.
